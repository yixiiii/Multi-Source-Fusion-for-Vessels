# Multi-source-Fusion-for-Vessels
Surface vessels detection and tracking method and datasets with multi-source data fusion in real-world complex scenarios
## Multi-source fusion dataset for intelligent vessel(WHUT-MSFVessel)
The constructed multi-source fusion dataset is available at:  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vnE5y9l18z2c-ZFSRfbD-g   
Pass Code: whut

The WHUT-MSFVessel dataset consists the data collect from different sensors, include AIS receiver, marine radar, and visible camera. All the data are synchronously collected, AIS data is stored in its raw coded format as text formats with timestamp, and radar and visible data are provided as continuous frame, each named with timestamp. All timestamps are accurate to the millisecond. The original format of the multi-source data in the dataset is as follow:
